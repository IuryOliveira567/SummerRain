# Summer Rain

Hi there!

This is my first front end project using some new technologies i've learned such as Vue js and SASS.<br/>
Summer Rain is a landing page of an online store.

### SETUP
<code>npm install</code> to install all the dependencies<br/>

### Compiles and minifies for production

<code>npm run build</code>

### Lints and fixes files
<code>npm run lint</code>

<code>npm run serve</code> to run in your localhost
